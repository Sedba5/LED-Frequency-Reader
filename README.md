# LED-Frequency-Reader
The goal of this project was to have a circuit that would detect and send frequency to an Arduino, make a code to read that analog signal, calculate it then monitor it as its numerical frequency, and then have that code send it to an LCD display. The project was successful, but it could use a bit more work to be more accurate. If this project had to be done again, it would be desired that the system as a whole be more compact.
